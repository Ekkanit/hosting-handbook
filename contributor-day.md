# Contributor Day

The Contributor Day is an event, usually parallel to a WordCamp, focused on contributing to the WordPress Community in any of its teams.

To participate in a Contributor Day it is only necessary to have a WordPress.org account, and, if possible, access to a Slack team channel.

## User account

### WordPress.org user account

**If you already have a user account**, you can [access the Login screen and log in](https://login.wordpress.org/). If you don't remember your password, [you can get an email and change it](https://login.wordpress.org/lostpassword).

**If you do not have a user account**, you can [access the Registry of a new account](https://login.wordpress.org/register) and enter the desired username and an email account where you will receive the emails. Once completed, you will receive an email to validate the account, and you can access with your username and password.

To check your WordPress profile, visit your [Profile Page](https://profiles.wordpress.org/me/).

### WordPress Slack user account

When you create a WordPress.org user account, an email account is automatically created like <your_wordpress.org_username@chat.wordpress.org>, where _your_wordpress.org_username_ is the chosen user.

To access the WordPress Slack, you can [register from the SignUp page](https://wordpress.slack.com/signup) and enter your username in the email account field. At that time you will receive the instructions by email to continue. If you had previously logged in, you just have to [visit the WordPress Slack home page](https://wordpress.slack.com/) and enter the Slack username and password.

Once you are there, please [visit the #hosting-community channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/hosting-community).

### GitHub user account _(optional)_

Some of the projects are developed through GitHub, so you may need an account.

**If you already have a GitHub account**, you can [access the Login screen and log in](https://github.com/login).

**If you do not have a user account**, you can [access the Registry of a new account](https://github.com/signup) and follow the steps.

#### Sync your WordPress.org and GitHub profile

In order for your contributions on GitHub to appear on your WordPress profile, you need to relate the account to your profile. To do this, visit the [Edit your WordPress Profile](https://profiles.wordpress.org/me/profile/edit/), and in the **GitHub Username** section add your GitHub account.

## Hosting Team projects

The projects of the Hosting team can vary, in addition to being able to cross with those of other teams.

Currently the list of projects to contribute is:

- [WordPress Hosting Team Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/), mainly focused on documentation.
- [Automated Hosting Tests](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/test-results/), mainly focused on PHP development.
- Advanced Admin Handbook, mainly focused on documentation, in collaboration with the [Documentation Team](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/).

### WordPress Hosting Team Handbook

#### What

The Handbook contains information about the Hosting Team, along with hosting recommendations for running WordPress.

The recommendations were put together by the team and used as a basis for [Site Health recommendations](https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/appendix/troubleshooting-using-the-health-check/) in WordPress. They're meant both as a reference for folks learning to host WordPress, and a way to help WordPress and Hosts improve together.

#### How

The handbook is in the process of being audited and improved. You can see the progress and contribute [through Github](https://github.com/WordPress/hosting-handbook).

The first thing you'll have to do is [visit the repository page](https://github.com/WordPress/hosting-handbook) where all the information is. It's best to [visit the Issues list](https://github.com/WordPress/hosting-handbook/issues), check if your proposal is already contemplated or pending, and if it isn't, [create a New issue](https://github.com/WordPress/hosting-handbook/issues/new).

After you submit an issue, we can discuss together the suggested changes.

Once a PR is submitted, it will require an approval process. By default, once it is submitted, it will require review and approval by two people from the Hosting team. In cases where there are PRs related to corrections or internal operational elements, created by someone from the Hosting Team, only one review will be required.

#### Tools

To work on this project yo will need:

- A GitHub account
- A text Editor
