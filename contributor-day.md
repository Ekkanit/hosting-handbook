# Contributor Day

The Contributor Day is an event, usually parallel to a WordCamp, focused on contributing to the WordPress Community in any of its teams.

To participate in a Contributor Day it is only necessary to have a WordPress.org account, and, if possible, access to a Slack team channel.

## User account

### WordPress.org user account

**If you already have a user account**, you can [access the Login screen and log in](https://login.wordpress.org/). If you don't remember your password, [you can get an email and change it](https://login.wordpress.org/lostpassword).

**If you do not have a user account**, you can [access the Registry of a new account](https://login.wordpress.org/register) and enter the desired username and an email account where you will receive the emails. Once completed, you will receive an email to validate the account, and you can access with your username and password.

To check your WordPress profile, visit your [Profile Page](https://profiles.wordpress.org/me/).

### WordPress Slack user account

When you create a WordPress.org user account, an email account is automatically created like <your_wordpress.org_username@chat.wordpress.org>, where _your_wordpress.org_username_ is the chosen user.

To access the WordPress Slack, you can [register from the SignUp page](https://wordpress.slack.com/signup) and enter your username in the email account field. At that time you will receive the instructions by email to continue. If you had previously logged in, you just have to [visit the WordPress Slack home page](https://wordpress.slack.com/) and enter the Slack username and password.

Once you are there, please [visit the #hosting-community channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/hosting-community).
