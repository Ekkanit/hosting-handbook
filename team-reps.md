# Team Reps

The WordPress initiative boasts a global array of contributors who engage in coding, support, translations, event organization, documentation writing, plugin and theme reviews, among other roles that shape the essence of the project.

These participants are organized into specific project teams. Every team has a dedicated space on the make.wordpress.org network to discuss and share updates about their contributions.

It's essential for each team to select, minimally, two Team Representatives. These representatives act as the voice of the team to the larger project, ensuring concerns are brought forward and tackled appropriately, and also facilitating collaborations between teams.
